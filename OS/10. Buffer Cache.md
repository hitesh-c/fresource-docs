## Chapter 10: Buffer Cache

- Two components are stored in the buffer cache: __Header Area__ and __Data Area__. Data area contains one block of the secondary storage. When there is a memory miss, then the CPU checks the buffer cache to see if the data block is in the data area before going directly to the secondary storage. If the block of data is in the buffer cache, then it is taken directly into user area of memory. If the data block is not in the buffer cache, then the CPU must go to access the data block from disk and then bring into the buffer cache. 

- Essentially, the purpose of the buffer cache is used to reduce the frequency of disk access. 

- If all the buffer cache is being used then one block is victimized using the LRU technique used in the Page memory management technique.

- The header area is used for block identification. It contains __device no__, __block no__ and __status__ which is obtained from the block found in the secondary storage. 

- Blocks found in the buffer area are maintained using double-linked lists. One of the pointer point to the Data Area. Another pointer points to __next buffer hash queue__. And the next pointer is pointing to the __previous buffer on hash queue__. Another one point to the __next buffer on free buffer list__. And the last one which points to the __previous buffer on free buffer list__.

- The __status__ field contains the following information:
  + buffer is currently blocked 
  + buffer contains corrupted data
  + buffer delayed write (when preparing changes to be rewritten to secondary storage)
  + buffer <--> secondary storage (reading and writing)
  + A process is currently waiting for the buffer to become free


- Using LRU, the block that is replaced in case the buffer doesn't contain any empty blocks, is the one that is at the head of the linked list. And the block being recently put into buffer is put at the tail of the list.

- Hash queues are used to reduce the search complexity that checks if a block exists in buffer cache. 

- If there are four block in the hash queue, the way to check where to place the block in the queues is decided by the following formula: (n mode 4). Below is an example of buffers in the hash queue.

```Pascal
H0 <--> 28 <--> 4  <--> 64 <-->
H1 <--> 17 <--> 5  <--> 97 <-->
H2 <--> 98 <--> 50 <--> 10 <-->
H3 <--> 3  <--> 35 <--> 99 <-->
```

- There could be a case where a buffer exist in the free buffer list and hash queue list. In other words free buffer list is a subset of hash queue list, where the free buffer list in entirely present in the hash queue list. The two lists can be connected using the pointers. 


- The algorithm for obtaining a block, executed by the kernel:

```Pascal
While (buffer not found): // run this block until buffer was made free to load in block
  if (block in hash queue): 
    if (buffer locked):
      sleep (event: buff become free); //process waits (go to sleep)
      continue;
    mark buff busy; // lock buffer
    remove buff from free list;
    return buffer;
  else:
    if (there are no buffer on free list):
      sleep (event: any buff become free);
      continue;    
    remove buff from F.L.;
    if (buff marked delayed write);
      asynchronous write buffer to disk;
      continue;
    remove from old hash queue
    put buff in new H.Q.
    return buff; // buffer made available to process to read in new block.
```

- Algorithm for releasing block

```Pascal
wakeup all processes: waiting for any buffer to become free;
wakeup all processes: waiting for this buffer to become free;

if (buffer contents valid and not old):
  enqueue buff at end of free list; // protecting recently used buffer
else:
  enqueue buffer at head of free list;

unlock the buffer
```

- When the kernel finds that a buffer is in a __delayed write state__, the content of that buffer is immediately written back to disk. After the writing is done, then the buffer is returned back to the free list (head of free list since it has already been saved back to disk). 

- Algorithm for reading block:

```Pascal
// output (free buffer or a buffer containing the block that is requested)
get buffer for block; invokes (get block algorithm); 

if (buffer data is valid):
  return the buffer to the process;

initiate disk read into the buffer;
process goes to sleep (event: disk read is complete);
return (buffer);
```

- Algorithm for block read ahead (reading a block from disk into buffer cache)

```Pascal
if (first block is not in cache):
  get buffer for first block;
  initiate disk read;

if (second block is not in cache):
  get buff for second block;
  initiate disk read (asynchronous);

if (first block in cache):
  return buffer;
```

- Algorithms for writing block

```Pascal
Initiate disk write;
if (write operation is synchronous):
  process goes to sleep until (event: write operation is complete)
  release buffer; invoke release block algorithm

elseif (buffer marked as delayed write):
  mark buffer as old
  return buffer to head of free list
```
