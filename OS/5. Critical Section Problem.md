## Chapter 5: Critical Section Problem

- Whenever a variable (e.g., counter) is being accessed and modified by two different processes, such as the consumer and producer process, this kind of problem is known as the __critical section problem__. 

- A plausible solution is to only allow either the producer process or consumer process to access the variable, finish its operation and then allow for the other to access and modify the variable. This can also be called the __atomic property__. It can also be referred to as __mutually exclusive__.

- These are the following requirements that must be met to solve the critical section problem:
    + __Mutual Exclusion (ME)__ - only one process should be given access to the critical section at a time. 
    + __Progress__ - Given a set of processes _P = {P1, P2, ...,Pn}_, only one process _Pi_ should be allowed to enter the __critical region_. The rest of processes must wait until _Pi_ finishes. The decision about who goes into the critical section can only be taken by the processes that are set to go into the critical section, and must be taken in finite time. 
    + __Bounded Waiting__ - When a process _Pi_ has put a request to enter the critical section at time _To_, it must wait until no process is running in the critical section. It also means that no other process can enter the critical section before the selecting process _Pi_. It serves as a assurance that its request to enter the critical section is satisfied.

- The __Entry Section__ - decides what process can enter into the critical section. A __lock__ is used to indicate that no other process can enter the critical section. 

- The __Exit Section__ - decides when the critical section becomes unlocked and free to accept another process.  

- The __Remainder Section__ - this is part of the code that doesn't involve the critical section. 

- Given _P1_ and _P2_ and a shared variable __turn__, which takes value of 1 and 2, the following code inserts a process into the critical section:

```Pascal
P(i): While turn != i do skip; //execute next line if its a process turn
        CS
      turn = j; // change turn
```
  
- The previous code satisfies ME, ensuring that no two processes enter the critical section simultaneously. 

- If a process _P1_ in the critical section terminates and gives control to a Process _P2_ that doesn't want to go into the critical section, we won't be able to meet progress. The reason is because _P2_ doesn't have an exit statement that indicates to give the critical section to another process _P1_

- The following algorithm satisfies the __Progress__ criteria:

```Pascal
flag: array [0..1] of boolean
P(i)  While flag[j] do skip; // decides if _Pi_ can go into the critical section
      flag[i] = True;
        CS
      flag[i] = False;
```

- With the above code, progress is satisfied but ME is not satisfied.

```Pascal
// Shared variables
  var flag: array[0..1] of boolean;
      turn: 0..1;
P(i): flag[i] = true
      turn = j; // check if _Pj_ wants access to Critical Section
      while(flag[j] and turn = j) do skip; // if any is false, then execute next line.
        CS
      flag[i] = false; 
```

- The above algorithm meets the three requirements: ME, progress and boundedness. Therefore, it is a correct solution to solve the critical section problem for two processes. 

- For _n_ process, the following algorithm is the solution:

```Pascal
Common (Global) variables:
  var flag: array[0..n-1] of (idle, want_in, in_cs);
  turn: 0..n-1;
P(i): var j:0..n;
      // Entry section of code
      repeat 
        flag[i] =  want_in;
        j =  turn;
        while j!= i do
          if flag[i] != idle then j = turn;
          else j = (j+1) mod n;
        flag[i] = in_cs;
        j = 0;
        while (j < n) and (j = i or flag[j] != in_cs) do
          j = j + 1;
      until (j >= n) and (turn = i or flag[turn] = idle);
      turn = ij;
      // critical section
      CS
      // exit section of code
      j = (turn + 1) mod n;
      while (flag[i] = idle) do  j = (j + 1) mod n;
      turn = j;
      flag[i] = idle;
      // remainder section
      RS
```
- There are some other implementations that can provide a solution to the critical section problem. These solution are categorize in two types of solutions: __Software Solution__ and __Hardware Solution__. An example of a hardware solution used in solving the critical solution problem is given in the following snippets of code:

```Pascal
function Test_and_Set(var target: boolean): boolean;
  begin
    Test_and_Set = target;
    target = True;
  end;
```
```Pascal
Procedure swap(var a,b: boolean);
  var temp: boolean;
  begin
    temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
  end;
```

```Pascal
Common (Global) variables:
  var waiting: array[0..n-1] of boolean;
  lock: boolean;
P(i): // local variables
      var j: 0..n-1;
      key: boolean;
      // entry section
      waiting[i] = true
      key = true;
      while (waiting[i] and key) do key = Test_and_Set(lock);
      waiting[i] = false;
      // the critical section
      CS
      // the exit section (this decides what goes into CS next)
      j = (i + 1) mod n;
      while (j != i) and (not waiting[j]) do j = (j + 1) mod n;
      if j = 1 then lock = false;
        else waiting[j] = false;
```

- __Semaphore variable__ - used to solve of the problems encountered by the operating system. It can be an integer variable which could be initialized and can be accessed only through two atomic operations: _P operation_ and _V Operation_. A process that is making some changes to a variable has to be completed in order to start the execution of another process on that same variable. Only then can the system ensure proper __context switching__.

```Pascal
S
P(S): While S <= 0 do skip;
      S = S - 1;
V(S): S = S + 1;
```
```C
mutex: semaphore; // assuming mutex = 1;
P(i): P(mutex)
      CS
      V(mutex)
      RS
```

- The semaphore variable mutex keeps switching the value from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0 to indicate whether another process can enter the critical section. This satisfies the ME requirement.

-__ Process synchronization__ : states that a semaphore variable _Sj_ can only be executed if a semaphore variable _Si_ has already executed and terminated. The algorithmic solution for this is as follows:

```Pascal
sync: semaphore;
sync = 0;
P(sync)
Sj

Si
V(sync)

```

- The above solution can be used in the synchronization of two processes, running in parallel. At some point, a process _P1_ is waiting for the execution of a set of instruction in _P2_. Semaphore variables can be used to allow for waiting and syncing the process with the input of the other.

- Given the following example of precedence graph: S1 --> S2; S1 --> S3; S2 --> S4; S4 --> S5; S4 --> S6; S3 --> S6; S5 --> S7; S6 --> S7...
  - It was said that it can be solved using the `Fork/Join` construct but not using the `Cobegin/Coend` construct. 
  - This precedence graph can also be represented using semaphore variables and below is a solution:
  
```Pascal
var a,b,c,d,e,f,g : semaphore <--0
begin
  cobegin
    begin
      S1; V(a);V(b);
    end;
    begin
      P(a); S2; S4; V(c); V(d);
    end;
    begin
      P(b); S3; V(e);
    end;
    begin
      P(c); S5; V(f);
    end;
    begin
      P(d); P(e); S6; V(g);
    end;
    begin
      P(f); P(g); S7;
    end;
  coend
end;
```

- In the above solution, ever block is sequential. All processes are running concurrent but must wait for V(x) to finish execution.

- With the code above, there is a new problem that arises. This problem is called __busy waiting problem__. What this means is that the processes are keeping the CPU busy without getting any positive result. This can be reduced by modifying the definition of semaphore variables. 

- The new definition of the semaphore variable looks like the following:

```Pascal
type semaphore = record
                  value: integer;
                  L: list of processes;
                end;
var S: semaphore; // s.value and s.L

// P operation
P(S): S.value = S.value - 1;
      if s.value < 0 then
        begin
          add this process to S.L;
          block; // putting the process in the wait state (no CPU consumption)
        end;
      end;

// V operation
V(S): S.value = S.value + 1;
      if s.value <= 0 then
        begin
          remove process P from S.L;
          wakeup(P); // change state from WAIT to READY
        end;
      end;
```

- Semaphore variables can also be used to solve the Producer/Consumer Problem. The following is a possible implementation:

```Pascal
full, empte, mutex: semaphore;
nextp, nextc: item;
full = 0;
empty = n; // indicate the number of items in buffer
mutex = 1; // maintain mutual exclusion of buffer

// Producer process
P:  repeat
      produce an item in nextp;
      ...
      P(empty)
      P(mutex)
      ...
      add nextp to buffer;
      ...
      V(mutex)
      V(full)
    until false;  

// Consumer process
C:  repeat
      P(full);
      P(mutex);
      ...
      remove an item from buffer to nextc;
      ...
      V(mutex)
      V(empty)
      ...
    until false;
```

- Another problem that can be solved using semaphore variables is the __Reader/Writer__ Problem. Only one writer process should be allowed to _access_ the file at a time. Also, many reader processes can access the file simultaneously. But if the one writer process is _modifying_ a file, then no reader process should be given access to that file. If there is one reader process accessing the file, then no other writer process should be allowed to access the file. 

- The following implementation is a solution for the reader/writer problem using semaphore variables:

```Pascal
mutex, wrt: semaphore; <-- 1
readcount: integer; <-- 0

// reader process
R:
  P(mutex);
  readcount = readcount + 1;
  if readcount = 1 then P(wrt);
  V(mutex) // before this statement is executed, no other process can execute the previous two lines of code.
  ...
  Read
  ...
  P(mutex);
  readcount = readcount - 1;
  if readcount = 0 then V(wrt); // release the file when exiting the last reader process.
  V(mutex);

// writer process
W: 
  P(wrt);
  ...
  Writes
  ...
  V(wrt);
```

- In such operations, __atomicity__ in ensured by providing priority levels in the CPU scheduling.
