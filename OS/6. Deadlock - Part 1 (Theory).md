## Chapter 6: Deadlock Part 1 (Theory)

- __Review:__ The main function of the operating system is to manage the resources which are to be shared by more than one processes. 

- Given two processes _P1_ and _P2_, requiring two resources _A_ and _B_... There could be a scenario where _P1_ has acquired resource _A_ and is waiting for resource _B_, which has been acquired by another process _P2_, which is also waiting for the same process that was initially acquired by _P1_. This situation leads to a __deadlock__ where both processes will never complete since they both depend on resources which were previously acquired by either one them. 

- The deadlock problem can also be modeled this way: _P1_ acquires _A_ and _P2_ acquires B; _P1_ needs _B_ to complete and _P2_ needs _A_ to complete. 

- To avoid deadlock the assigning of resources to processes needs an efficient assigning mechanism. This can done using the concept of requesting where a process that needs a resource must first request to use that resource. A life cycle or sequence of a request for a resource: __Request__ --> __Use__ --> __Release__.

- __Deadlock Definition__:
> A set of processes is said to be in deadlock when every process in the set waits for an event that can only be caused by another process in the set.

- In our previous example, _P1_ is waiting for the __release event__ by the other process _P2_.

- There are four conditions for the occurrence of a deadlock:
    - 1. __Mutual Exclusion__ - at least one resource in the system which cannot be shared simultaneously by more than one process.
    - 2. __Hold and Wait__ - a process is holding and waiting for a resource.
    - 3. __No preemption__ - no interrupt of the process running.
    - 4. __Circular Wait__ - an extension of Hold and Wait. 

- If we can ensure that one of the condition from the list above is not present, then we can say that the system is deadlock free. 

- In a system, we can have the following resources:
    + Finite number of resources.
    + Various types of resources.
    + Every type has a number of identical resource instances.

- A deadlock situation can be represented using a graph technique (Resource Allocation Graph). Given a graph G = (V,E), Vertices (V) represent processes and resource type. Edges (E) represent request edges (_Pi_, _Rj_) and allocation edges (_Rj_, _Pi_). 

- Given the processes _P1_, _P2_ and _P3_; and the following resources _R1_, _R2_, _R3_ and _R4_. _R1_ and _R3_ have one resource instance while _R2_ and _R4_ each have 2 and 4 instances, respectively. Below are the following requests and allocations:

```Pascal
P1 --> R1; // request
P1 <-- R2(2); // instance 2
P2 <-- R1; // allocation
P2 --> R3;
P2 <-- R2(1);
P3 <-- R3;
```

- The above situation doesn't present a deadlock.

- If we modify the list of allocation and requests as the following:

```Pascal
P1 --> R1; // request
P1 <-- R2(2); // instance 2
P2 <-- R1; // allocation
P2 --> R3;
P2 <-- R2(1);
P3 <-- R3;
P3 --> R2; // this request presents a deadlock; there is not enough instances in R2
```

- If there is a cycle in the graph, __there is a possibility__ of a deadlock, especially if there is only _one instance of a resource type_. 

- Deadlocks are better handling using an avoid strategy rather than detecting and killing processes. 

- There are three strategies for dealing with deadlock:
  + 1. __Deadlock Prevention__ - in this approach, the system prevents deadlock by breaking any of the four criteria that make up a deadlock. Restriction is placed on the way processes request resources. 
  + 2. __Deadlock Avoidance__ - no restriction on the way processes request resources; such method avoids the natural cycle that leads to deadlock. 
  + 3. __Deadlock Detection and Recovery__


- __Deadlock Prevention__ and the four criteria:
  + __ME__ - cannot be broken since a nonshareable resource can only be acquired by one process.
  + __Hold and Wait__ - when a process requests a resource, a condition can be placed for that process to release any resources that is has acquired before. Another way is to have a process execute only when it has requested and acquired all necessary resources (inefficient use of resources). Starvation is also possible since another process might be waiting for a resource that is always allocated to some other process.
  + __No preemption__ - Given the following scenario: _Pi_ --> _Rj_ --> _Pj_; _Pi_ is not allowed to request any other resource if _Rj_ is being held by another process. Additionally, _Pi_ must release all other resources which it had acquired before. 
  + __Circular Wait__ - Allows the process to request resources in a particular order. Establish a mapping function to achieve this. 

- Circular wait mapping function:

```Pascal
F: R -> N
F(Ri) < F(Rj)
P1 --> R1 --> P2 --> R2 --> P3 --> ... Rn-1 --> Pn --> Rn --> P1

// in order to avoid the circular wait it must follow the following rules
F(R1) > F(Rn)
F(R2) > F(R1)
...
F(Rn) > F(Rn-1)
```

- One way this may not be possible is when the system doesn't know the order in which the processes requested the resources. 

- __Deadlock Avoidance:__ The processes must let the system know in advance what are the maximum requirements for requesting and acquiring resources. Once knowing all the requirements of the processes, then it can take decisions to make some processes wait in order to avoid deadlock. One such algorithm used to solve this problem is called the __Banker's Algorithm__.
