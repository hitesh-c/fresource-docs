## Chapter 6.1: Deadlocks

- A process waiting for access to another resource which is also held by other waiting processes.

- A process must request a resource before using it and must release it after using it.

- sequence of processes requesting and using resources are made through system calls: request -> use -> release

- Deadlock occurs when the following four conditions arise simultaneously:
  + Mutual Exclusion - only one process at a time can use the resource.
  + Hold and Wait - A process must be holding at least one resource and waiting to acquire additional resources that are currently being held by other resources.
  + No preemption - a resource can only be released by the process that has acquired it; no preemption of resource are allowed.
  + Circular wait - every process in a set is waiting for a resource that is being held by another process in the set, to create a circular waiting scheme.

- > If a resource-allocation graph does not have a cycle, then the system is not in a deadlock state. If there is a cycle, then the system may or may not be in a deadlocked state.
