## Chapter 11: File Representation

### File System

- File is the smallest allotment of logical secondary storage; 

- Directory consist of the file's name and its unique identifier

- File operations carried provided by the OS
  + Creating a file - find space, then write entry to directory
  + Writing a file - find file, write pointer to keep track of where to write next
  + Reading a file - find file, read pointer to keep track of where to read next
  + Repositioning within a file - find file in directory, reposition current-file position pointer (no i/o required) 
  + Deleting a file - find file, release space, erase the directory entry
  + Truncating a file - find file, delete all other information, and keep all other attributes (e.g., name)

- Open File Table - keeps track of all open file and avoids the need to search the directory all over again.

- Open file - keeps track of the file information as per access by all processes; these include: file pointer, file-open count, disk location of the file, access right;

- current file position pointer - keeps track of read and write pointer

- Internal fragmentation occurs because blocks are not entirely used and the remaining space accumulate to cause fragmentation.

- Access methods:
  + Sequential Access - read and write back and forward from a file
  + Direct Access - random access to read and write

- Any entity (partition) containing a file system is known as a volume (virtual disk). The volume may be a subset of a devise, a whole devise, or multiple devises linked together into a RAID set (used for providing protection from disk failure).

- user file directory (UFD) - in a two level directory every user has a directory; when a user logs in, the system's master file directory (MFD) is searched - the MFd is indexed by user name or account number, and each entry points to the UFD for that user.


- absolute path - contain all the path of a file from the root directory

- relative path - contain the path of a file from the current directory

- Acyclic graph, different from tree structured directory, allows for sharing of files and directories.

- Garbage collection involves traversing the entire file system, to recover unused disk space.

- Distributed File Systems - instead of terminating all operations, the DFS delays access with the hope that the remote host will become available again.

- A files session : a series of open() and close() operations

- Immutable file system - the share content is fixed and cannot be change (read-only mode).

- The most general scheme to implement identity dependent access is to associate with each file and directory and access-control list (ACL) specifying user name and the types of access allowed for each user.


### File Implementation

- logical file system - knows the structure of directories

- File control block (FCB) - contains information about a file (ownership, permission, etc.):
  + file permissions
  + file dates (create, access, write)
  + file owner, group, ACL
  + file size
  + file data blocks or pointers to file data blocks


- On disk, the file system may contain information about:
  + Boot block - usually the first block in a volume
  + Volume control block - size of the blocks, free-block count, free-block pointers
  + Directory Structure - file names and associated inode numbers
  + FCB - details of a file and identifier to associate with a directory

- in-memory contains system-wide open-file table and per-process open file table

- in memory mount table - contains information of the volumes mounted

- Buffers hold the file-system blocks when they are being read from disk or written to disk.

- The virtual file system (VFS) sit in the middle of the file system interface and files/directory, thus, distinguishing local files from remote ones; local files are distinguished according to their file system; The VFS is based on a file-representation structure, called a vnode, that contains a numerical designator for a network-wide unique file (necessary to support NFS); VFS only find what operation to execute based on the type of object (it looks into the object's function table to decide which exact version of the function to execute).

- Directory Implementation:
  + Linear List - list of file names with pointers to the data blocks; linear search to find a file
  + Hash Table - hash table with pointer to the entry in linear list; decrease search time; can allow collision with two file names hash to the same location; solved by having each hash entry become a linked list; 

- Three methods for allocating disk space effectively so that file can be accesses quickly: 
  + Contiguous - space is allocated contiguously, minimizing seek time; supports both sequential and direct access; directory entry of a file contains address of starting block and length of the block; difficult to find contiguous space for a new file since blocks could be randomly spread; also suffers from external fragmentation; another problem is that it is difficult to know the size of a file
  + Linked - each file is a linked list of disk blocks, scattered anywhere in the disk; each block contains a pointer to the next block; each directory entry has a pointer to the first disk block of the file; doesn't suffer from external fragmentation; only effective for sequential access files (read must happen from the first block of the file and find connecting blocks through the pointers); inefficient for direct-access; pointers also require storage; cluster of blocks instead of single blocks may reduce the space needed to store the pointers to each block; cluster approach suffers from internal fragmentation as more space is wasted through clusters than by single blocks; file allocation table (FAT) keeps entries of each disk block to support direct access; FATs are usually stored at the beginning block of a volume;
  + Indexed - each file has an index block, which is an array of disk block addresses; the directory contains the address of the index block only; it supports direct access, without suffering from external fragmentation; one drawback is the size of index block


- Free space manage (keeping a list of free blocks):
  + bit map - each bit represent a block and it has 1 for unallocated, 0 for allocated
  + linked list - first pointer to the disk block is stored in memory and the rest of blocks have a pointer to a next free block; FAT has this capability already
  + grouping - storing addresses of n free blocks in the first free block; then those n-1 free blocks have a lost block which points to another set of free blocks;
  + counting - store address of first free block and number of contiguous blocks in the free blocks list
  + ZFS - a log plus a balanced tree is the free list.

- Disk controller - moves disk tracks into main memory and then to cache if needed

- Buffer cache - blocks are kept under the assumption that they will be used again shortly




- Index node (Inode) - stores the __disk layout__ of every file in the directory.

- The logical disk layout contains __boot block__, __super block__, __inode list__, __data block__.

- The location information of data blocks is stored in the Inode list.

- Super block contains:
  + how large the file system is
  + how many files it can store
  + where to find the free blocks in the file system
  + what are the free inodes

- For every read/write to a file, the Inode must be referenced because it contains the address and other key information of that file on disk. 

- To speed up the access of a data block from the file system, a copy of the inode list for that directory, called __incore inode__, is stored in main memory. When the inode is stored in the disk it is simply called __disk inode__.

- The disk inode contains the following information:
  + Ownership : who owns a specific file / directory
    * group / individual
  + Type (regular file or directory)
  + Permission field (read/write/execute - rwx)
  + access time
  + modification time
  + inode modified time
  + file size
  + disk address of different data blocks (TOC)

- The __Incore inode__ contains the following information:
  + Status 
      * 1. Locked
      * 2. A process is waiting for inode to become unlocked
      * 3. Changed
      * 4. File (corresponding to inode) changed or not
  + Device no. of File System
  + Inode Identification number (disk inode stored sequentially, therefore, doesn't need an identification number)
  + pointer fields (hash list and free list)
  + Reference Count - number of times inode is being referenced

- Whenever the reference count of an inode becomes 0, then the inode is pushed into the __inode free list__. 

- To access a specific byte in a file, a process must first get information about the address of that file in the inode. The inode is then locked (to avoid any changes) and the block address is obtained from the TOC. After the address has been obtained then the inode is unlocked again. When the inode become locked, no other process can access the file.

- __The inode table of contents (TOC)__:
  + The entries in a TOC contain 12 blocks of address. The first 10 addresses (0-9) contain the addresses of the block which contains file data. They are also called direct pointers.
  + The next address (10) is a __single indirect pointer__ pointing to a block (containing a set of pointers). The set of pointers then point to a block which contains the file data.
  + The next address (11) is a __double indirect pointer__ pointing to a block (containing a set of pointers) which also points to another block containing a set of pointers. The last block of pointers then point to a block that contains the file data.
  + Similarly, the next address (12) contains a __triple indirect pointer__ that follows the same structure as the previous.

```Pascal
// Assuming:
Block Size --> 1 KByte

// then...
Address of Block --> 4 Bytes
Every address block will contain 256 pointers

Direct pointers (10 addresses) can access --> 10 KBytes 
Single Indirect Pointers --> 256 KBytes
Double Indirect Pointers --> 256 X 256 KBytes
Triple Indirect Pointers --> 256 X 256 X 256 KBytes (16 GBytes)
```

- During any file operation:
  + 1. First, check if the inode of that file is in memory (the file could potentially be used by another process)
  + 2. Get a free inode to overwrite with the inode of the new file (obtained from secondary storage).

- Algorithm for getting Inode

```Pascal
While (not done)
  // if inode in memory
  if (inode in inode cache)
    if (inode locked)
      sleep (event: inode is unlocked); // wait for inode to unlock
      continue;
    if (inode on free list) // reference count = 0
      remove inode from free list;
    increment Reference count field;
    return (inode);
  
  // if the inode not in memory
  if (no inode in free list)
    return (error);
  remove (new inode from free list);
  reset inode number and file system;
  remove inode from hash old queue;
  add inode into new hash queue;
  read disk inode from the disk;
  put disk inode into new incore inode (block read algorithm);
  initialize the inode; // reference set to 1
  return (node);
```

- Algorithm for release inode:

```Pascal
lock inode if not already locked;
decrement reference count field;
if (reference == 0)
  if (inode changed)
    update disk inode;
  put inode on free inode list;
release inode lock;
```

- Directory (a special kind of file)

- The type field indicates if the file is a directory or file.

- The content of a directory contains a list of inode numbers and file names as provided in the example below:

| Inode | File Name | Description                |
|-------|-----------|----------------------------|
| 83    | .         | entry of current directory |
| 50    | ..        | entry of parent directory  |
| 61    | passwd    | entry of subdirectory      |
| 30    | bin       | entry of subdirectory      |
| 99    | mkfs      | entry of subdirectory      |
| ...   | ...       | ...                        |

- File path of the subdirectory `passwd` can be specified as `passwd` or `/etc/passwd`.

- Algorithm for converting a path name to the inode number

```Pascal
if (pathname starts from root)
  working inode = root inode;
else
  working inode = current directory;

while (there is more pathname)
  read next pathname component from input;
  verify working directory inode is of directory and access permission okay;
  read directory;

  if (component matches an entry):
    get inode number for matched component;
    release working inode;
    working inode = inode of matched component;

  else:
    return (no inode);
return (working inode);
```

- All the previous algorithms assume that an inode is already bound to a file. This means that for creating a new file there are other operations which are needed to allocate an new inode to a file. The free inode is obtained from the free inode list found in the __super block__.

- The highest inode number in the super block free inode list is called the __remember inode__. This inode indicates where unallocated inodes will be available or free in the disk inode.

- Algorithm for allocating a new inode

```Pascal
while (not done)
  if (super block locked)
    sleep (event: s/b/ become free);
    continue;

  if (s.b. inode list empty)
    lock s.b.
    get remember inode for free inode search;
    search for free inodes until s.b. full OR no more free inodes;
    unlock s.b.l
    wakeup (event: s.b. free);
    if (not free inode found on disk)
      return (no inode);
    set remembered inode;
  
  get inode number from s.b. inode list;
  get inode (iget); // get incore inode
  initialize inode;
  write inode to disk;
  decrement free inode count;
  return (inode);
```

- Algorithm for freeing inode

```Pascal
increment free inode count
if (super block locked)
  return;
if (super block free inode list is full)
  if (inode number requested is less than remembered inode)
    set remembered inode = input inode number;
else
  store inode number in s.b. inode list
return;
```

- The super block also contains a __free data block list__, which is only a single block that contains a list of other data block numbers which are free. 

- A free data block list contains a linked list, which in turn contain pointers to other list of blocks. 

- A data block can never be allocated if its not found in the super data block list. 

- Whenever a block is allocated, a buffer has to also be simultaneously allocated. Only then can the disk block along with allocated buffer be accessed by a process. 

- Algorithm for allocation of disk blocks:

```Pascal
While (s.b. locked)
  sleep (event: s.b. not locked)

remove block no. from s.b. free block list;

if (removed last block from list)
  lock s.b.;
  remove block just taken from free list; // invoke block read algorithm
  copy block numbers into s.b.;
  release block buffer;
  unlock s.b.;
  wakeup process(event: s.b. not locked)

get buffer for block removed from s.b. list; // invoke get block algorithm
initialize buffer
decrement free block count;
mark s.b. modified;
return buffer;
```
