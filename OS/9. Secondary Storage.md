## Chapter 9: Secondary Storage

- The different types of secondary storage devises are:
  + Random Access Memory (RAM)(Main Memory) - (access time very small)
  + Serial Access Storage Devise (e.g., magnetic tape) - (access time very high)
  + Direct Access Storage Devise DASD (e.g., Mag Disk, Magnetic drum, floppy disk, compact disk)

- __Character Devise__ - data can be access byte by byte. (e.g., printer)

- __Block Devise__ - access an entire block first to access a particular byte. (e.g., Magnetic tape)

- Floppy disks contain different __concentric circles__ called __tracks__ as they are called in magnetic tapes. Tracks are then subdivided into __sectors__. to access a particular byte in a floppy disk, it must first access the track and the particular sector. 

- In __single-sided disks__, the data can be stored on one side of the disk. As for the __double-sided disks__, the data can be stored on both sides of the disk.

- For a double-sided disk, there must be two read/write heads present. For this to work, there must be a __head no__ as well. Head no decides which side of the disk is being accessed. 

- On a hard disk, in order to access a __block no__, there needs to be a three component address: __head no__, __cylinder no__, __sector no__.

- When there is a secondary storage present, the CPU first checks the cache memory for an instruction to execute; if not available, then the main memory; if not found then check the secondary storage.

- A __buffer cache__ is maintained to reduce the amount of overhead when accessing the hard disk. The buffer cache is maintained in the system area of the main memory. The buffer cache is only managed by the operating system and not by any user or program. In order for efficient access of data from the secondary storage, the buffer cache is used as a bridge between main memory and secondary storage.
