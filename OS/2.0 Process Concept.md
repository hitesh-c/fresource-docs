## Chapter 2.0: Process Concept

- Process - a program in execution

- The words job and process are frequently used interchangeably

- program counter - specifies the next instruction to execute

- Components of a process:
    + text section - program code
    + program counter - current activity
    + stack - temporary data (function parameters, return addresses,and local variables)
    + data section - global variables
    + heap - memory that is dynamically allocated during process run time

- States of a process:
    + new - the process is being created
    + running - instructions are being executed
    + waiting - the process is waiting for some even to occur
    + ready - the process is waiting to be assigned to a processor
    + terminated - the process has finished execution

- Each process is represented in the OS as a process control block (PCB), which include:
    + Process state
    + Program counter
    + CPU registers
    + CPU-scheduling information
    + Memory-management information
    + Accounting information
    + I/O status information

- Threads allows a process to perform more that one task concurrently (e.g., typing and spell-checking)

- Multicore systems allow for multiple thread to run concurrently. PCB is expanded to hold information for each thread.

- Representation of a process in LINUX:

```C
long state; /* state of the process */
struct shed_entity se; /* scheduling information */
struct task_struct *parent; /* this process's parent */
struct list_head children; /* this process's children */
struct files_struct *files; /* list of open files */
struct mm_struct *mm; /* address spec of this process */

/*  change the state of current process */
current->state = new_state;
```

- **Dispatch** - when a process is selected for execution
 
- **Context switch** - when the CPU is switched to another process, which requires a state save of the current process and a state restore of a different process.

- **Cascading termination** - when a parent process exits all other children processes of that process are also terminated. 

- Reasons for process cooperation:
    + Information sharing
    + Computation speedup
    + Modularity
    + Convenience

- Two types of buffers in shared-memory systems:
    + unbounded buffer - the consume may have to wait for new items, but the producer can always produce new items.
    + bounded buffer - the consumer must wait if the buffer is empty, and the producer must wait if the buffer is full

- In contrast to **shared-memory** environment, **message-passage** systems allow processes to communicate and to synchronize their actions without sharing the same address space.

- **Round robin** - processes take turns to receiving messages which uses mailbox (indirect communication environment).

- Message passing may be either blocking or nonblocking:
    + blocking send -  the sending process is blocked until the message is received by the receiving process or by the mailbox
    + nonblocking send - the sending process sends the message and resumes operations
    + Blocking receive - the receiver blocks until a massage it available
    + Nonblocking receive - the receiver retrieve either a valid message or a null

- > In contrast to IPC messages, the message exchanged in PRC communication are **well structured** and are thus no longer just packets of data.

- > Long term scheduling is the selection of processes that will be allowed to contend for the CPU. Normally, long-term scheduling is heavily influenced by resource-allocation considerations, especially memory management. Short-term scheduling is the selection of one process from the ready queue.

- > Ordinary pipes allow communication between parent and child processes, while named pipes permit unrelated processes to communicate.
